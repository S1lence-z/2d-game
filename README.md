# TODO List

- **Infinite Mode**: the player goes automatically to the right, platforms spawn in front of him
- **3 Levels**: make 3 hard-coded levels

# Space Runner

In this repository, I will be developing my semestral project for the subject programming 2 at MFF UK.

I will be developing a 2D jumping game in the likes of Mario. I will be developing the game in the Unity game engine.
The player will be controlling a character which can move left, right, up and down. The game will only have one infinite level and it will end when the player runs out of HP.

The main menu of the game will have the options to start the game, go to desktop and there will also be the player's high score of his current game session.
I will be developing the game here on my personal GitHub and then import it to GitLab.

# In-game items:

## Traps
1. **Spikes** - static trap
2. **Bouncing spike ball** - moving trap
3. **Vertically moving spike wheels** - moving trap (falling through a portal)
4. **Horizontally moving spike wheel** - moving trap

## Collectable Items
1. **Coins** - picking them up counts as the level's score
2. **O2 tank** - regenerates 1 HP (3 HP FULL)

## Static objects
1. **Crates** - static obstacle

In the process of development I may delete or add some features.
