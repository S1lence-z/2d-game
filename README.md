# Space Runner

In this repository, I will be developing my semestral project for the subject programming 2 at MFF UK.

I will be developing a 2D jumping game in the likes of Mario. I will be developing the game in the Unity game engine.
The player will be controlling a character which can move left, right, up and down. The game will only have one infinite level and it will end when the player runs out of HP. There will also be 3 predesigned levels avilable.

The main menu of the game will have the options to start the game, go to desktop and there will also be the player's high score of his current game session.
I will be developing the game here on my personal GitHub and then import it to GitLab.
